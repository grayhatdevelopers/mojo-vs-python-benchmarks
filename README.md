# Language Comparison: Python vs Mojo

Hey there! I am new to both Python and Mojo languages. In this repository, I went on a mission to explore and compare these two languages from scratch, knowing only the basics of programming

## Programs

1. **Length of last word**
2. 
   Description: returning the length of the last word in the string.
   

3. **Palindrome number:**
4. 
   Description: returning true if input is a palindrome and false otherwise.
  

5. **Student attendance record**
6. 
   Description: Whether or not the student is eligible for an attendance award
   
 
7. **Detect Capital letter usage**
8. 
   Description: Returning true if the usage of capitals in it is right.
   

9. **Find the difference:**
10. 
   Description: Returning the extra letter among 2 strings
   

## Benchmarking and Testing

The performance of both languages was benchmarked using Hyperfine. Programs were tested and outputs were compared to see which one of them was faster
