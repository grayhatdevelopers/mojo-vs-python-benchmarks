# Language Comparison: Python vs Mojo

This repository compares Python and Mojo programming languages through the development of five simple programs. The purpose is to explore and contrast the basics of each language and provide insights into their performance.

## Programs

1. **Hello World:**
   - Description: Basic program printing "Hello, World!" to the console.
   - [Python Code](link/to/python/hello_world.py)
   - [Mojo Code](link/to/mojo/hello_world.mojo)

2. **Sum Calculator:**
   - Description: Program to calculate the sum of two numbers.
   - [Python Code](link/to/python/sum_calculator.py)
   - [Mojo Code](link/to/mojo/sum_calculator.mojo)

3. **Factorial Calculator:**
   - Description: Program to compute the factorial of a given number.
   - [Python Code](link/to/python/factorial_calculator.py)
   - [Mojo Code](link/to/mojo/factorial_calculator.mojo)

4. **Fibonacci Sequence:**
   - Description: Program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit.
   - [Python Code](link/to/python/fibonacci_sequence.py)
   - [Mojo Code](link/to/mojo/fibonacci_sequence.mojo)

5. **Palindrome Checker:**
   - Description: Program to check if a given string is a palindrome.
   - [Python Code](link/to/python/palindrome_checker.py)
   - [Mojo Code](link/to/mojo/palindrome_checker.mojo)

## Benchmarking and Testing

The performance of both languages was benchmarked using [insert tools/methodologies]. Test scenarios, inputs, and expected outputs were carefully examined to provide a comprehensive overview of the languages' capabilities.

## Results

The results of the benchmarking and testing are outlined in [Results.md](link/to/results.md). Explore the findings to understand the strengths and weaknesses of Python and Mojo in different scenarios.
