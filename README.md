# Language Comparison: Python vs Mojo

Hey there! I am new to both Python and Mojo languages. In this repository, I went on a mission to explore and compare these two languages from scratch, knowing only the basics of programming

## Programs

1. **Length of last word**
   Description: returning the length of the last word in the string.
   

2. **Palindrome number:**
   Description: returning true if input is a palindrome and false otherwise.
  

3. **Student attendance record**
   Description: Whether or not the student is eligible for an attendance award
   
 
4. **Detect Capital letter usage**
   Description: Returning true if the usage of capitals in it is right.
   

5. **Find the difference:**
   Description: Returning the extra letter among 2 strings
   

## Benchmarking and Testing

The performance of both languages was benchmarked using Hyperfine. Programs were tested and outputs were compared to see which one of them was faster
